hello-world
===========

This is a test of some basic functionaliy in Github and I may use it at some stage to host some files on some BS that I'm working on in my spare time.  Who knows.

Do I actually have any spare time?  

What is 'Spare' time?

I'm always doing something so technically I never have any 'spare' time.

It's not like I could give 'spare' time to someone else to use.

Or can I?  is that prostitution?

Anyway - I digress.
